-This repository was created to address the question, how do *Sarracenia* characteristics predict biomass?

-The data set used to study this contains all of these data for different species in the *Sarracenia* family:

"the effects of prey availability on photosynthetic rate (Amass), chlorophyll fluorescence, growth, architecture, and foliar nutrient and chlorophyll content of ten pitcher plant (Sarracenia) species. We tested the hypothesis that increased prey availability would stimulate Amass of one or more leaves, increase photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUEN, PNUEP), increase relative biomass allocation to photosynthetically efficient, non-predatory phyllodes rather than pitchers, increase overall plant biomass, and reduce stress-related chlorophyll fluorescence."

The files used to create this data analysis are the csv file of the field data, scratch code, and final code. Both code files use the same data csv file from Harvard. The scratch code was used to create the code for analysis and the final code is what will be referenced for the results.
